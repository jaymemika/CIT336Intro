    My name is...
    <p>
      Jayme Mika!
      <br>
      I'm a sophomore majoring in communications and minoring in web media and arts and entertainment management. I'm from New Jersey and live on campus during the school year. Currently I'm interning at a non-profit grassroots book publishing company where I manage their social media and website. My favorite things to do are reading, hiking, and playing video games (although I'm pretty bad at them). The worst thing about living away from home is being away from my all my pets!

    My web development experience includes...
    <br>
    <p>
      I took my first real computing class at Pace (<a href="http://webpage.pace.edu/jm10982n/cis101/home.html">CIS101</a>) where we learned HTML and CSS and really took a liking to it. From there I wanted to learn more about web scripting so I decided I would do a minor in it, really just for my own interest as I'm not sure I would ever use these skills in my professional career. Last semester I took <a href="http://webpage.pace.edu/jm10982n/Project/home.html">CIT235</a>, which focused again on HTML and CSS, but with a litte JavaScript thrown in, and now I'm taking this course. The only 'experience' I've had would be building websites for the classes I've took.<br><br>

    Why I'm taking this class...
    <br>
    <p>
      I'm taking this class for my minor in web media. Like I previously mentioned, this minor is more for my own personal interest. I really like web/graphic design, so being able to create and develop my own webiste appeals to me. The previous two classes focused a lot on HTML and CSS so I hope to really master those skills as well as learn some new ones to make websites more interactive and visually appealing.

    My plan for the future is to...
    <br>
    <p>
      I plan to graduate in May 2020 with a few internship experiences on my resume. I would like to work in a field that I love such as the publishing industry, an environmental group, or video game company (basically the three hobbies I listed above). Ideally, I would be a 'manager' or 'director' in relations through media and events, which is something that is needed in every company. My one main career goal is to promote something that I'm passionate about.
